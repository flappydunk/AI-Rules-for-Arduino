# AI-Rules-for-Arduino
This project was designed to provide a Rules based control system. The example project demonstrates the method whereby a control system can be developed with little coding of the core process. The Rules system is flexible allow updates to command and control more simply. Including real time monitoring and allowing a complete view of your state of the system readily available. The system can be developed on a spreadsheet to generate HEX codes for the Rules that are added to the "Rules_prog.h" arrays. I have put together a demonstration of a simple rules based system to illustrate, see Rules-Demo branch. 

Other projects will be added using this method. 
A robotic lawnmower "Robo Grazer". A fully functional mower. Partly based on "Ardumower" hardware, motors, perimeter etc but with a completely different control system.
